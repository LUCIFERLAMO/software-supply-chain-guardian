# Software Supply Chain Security Guardian 🛡️

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to build an automated security gatekeeper that lives inside a software development pipeline. It will inspect all open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license issues, automatically blocking insecure code before it gets merged.

## The Problem It Solves
Modern applications are built using hundreds of open-source packages, creating a complex supply chain. A single vulnerable package can compromise an entire application, as seen with major incidents like Log4j. This tool aims to mitigate that risk proactively.
